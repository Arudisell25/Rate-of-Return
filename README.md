## Returned Orders Analysis

### Data Sources
The data appears to be sourced from a company's order and return records. Key data points include:

- Product categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture).
- Regional data (Central, East, South, West).
- Shipping modes and return rates.
- Temporal data such as quarters and weekdays of order dates.
- Specific product information (e.g., Advantus Push Pins).

### Tools and Technologies Used
The visualization suggests the use of:

- Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations (evident from the design style and interactivity like maps and charts).
- Mapbox for geographic representation of returns by state.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
Steps likely involved in preparing the data:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent formatting for dates, regions, and product categories.
- **Data Transformation:** Aggregating return rates by categories, states, and shipping modes.
- **Normalization:** Standardizing data formats for analysis across quarters and weekdays.
- **Integration:** Combining multiple datasets (e.g., sales data with returns data) for comprehensive insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights derived from the dashboard:

- **Category Analysis:** Office Supplies have the highest return rate across all states.
- **Regional Trends:** The West Region shows the highest return rate for same-day shipping.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Returns fluctuate significantly by quarter, with peaks in specific periods like Q4 2020.
- **Product Insights:** Advantus Push Pins have the highest return rate among products.
- **Day Analysis:** Returns are more frequent on specific weekdays.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Focus on Office Supplies:** Investigate why this category has higher returns across all states. Consider improving product quality or customer education.
- **Regional Optimization:** Address issues in the West Region's same-day shipping process to reduce returns.
- **Quarterly Trends:** Prepare for higher returns during peak periods like Q4 by enhancing customer support and return policies.
- **Product-Specific Action:** Evaluate Advantus Push Pins to identify quality or usability issues.

### Future Work and Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics:** Use machine learning models to predict future return trends based on historical data.
- **Customer Feedback Integration:** Incorporate customer reviews and complaints to understand reasons behind high returns.
- **Granular Analysis:** Dive deeper into state-wise trends to identify specific causes of high returns in Utah.
- **Shipping Improvements:** Analyze shipping methods further to optimize processes for regions with high same-day shipping returns.

This dashboard provides actionable insights that can help improve operational efficiency, reduce return rates, and enhance customer satisfaction.
